                        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">We value our customers and aim to resolve disputes amicably. Before initiating any formal legal proceeding, you agree to first contact FiberSolution's customer service department or legal department to explain your grievance and attempt to resolve the dispute informally. Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction through this process. You agree to make a good faith effort for at least sixty (60) days to resolve the dispute informally before pursuing arbitration or small claims court as described below.</p>

                        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-3 leading-relaxed">Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court or disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your or FiberSolution‚Äôs intellectual property rights (e.g., trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets), you and FiberSolution agree that any and all past, present, or future disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Services, any equipment or advertising, or your relationship with FiberSolution (collectively, "Disputes") shall be resolved exclusively and finally by BINDING ARBITRATION, rather than in court.</p>
                        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-3 leading-relaxed">The arbitration will be administered by a nationally recognized arbitration provider mutually agreed upon by the parties (e.g., the American Arbitration Association - AAA, or JAMS) under its applicable Commercial Arbitration Rules (or Consumer Arbitration Rules, if you are an individual consumer and those rules are deemed applicable). The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>

If this specific class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision (except for the jury trial waiver) shall be null and void.</p>
