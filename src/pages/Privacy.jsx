We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under the relevant age without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to delete such information from our records promptly. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us using the details in Section 10.</p>

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Your personal information may be processed in and transferred to countries other than your country of residence, including the United States, where our servers and central database are located. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country. When we transfer your personal information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy and in accordance with applicable law, by ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses, adequacy decisions, or your consent where required).</p>
